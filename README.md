# DD2480 -Software Engineering Fundamentals - Group 27

A project repository for the course DD2480 Software Engineering Fundamentals at KTH.

## Contributions

The workload was split evenly among the group members such that each group member was responsible for 4-6 functions of the program. The group also had (almost) daily meetings to make sure that the work ran smoothly for everyone. In addition to the assigned tasks, all group members contributed to the creation of issues and the reviewing of pull requests.
